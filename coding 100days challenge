topics:Arrays
list of important questions related to arrays in the context of data structures and algorithms (DSA):

Reverse an Array: Write a function to reverse the elements of an array in-place.

Rotate Array: Rotate an array to the right by k steps.

Maximum Subarray Sum: Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

Array Partitioning: Partition an array into two parts such that the elements in one part are less than or equal to a given value, and the elements in the other part are greater than the given value.

Merge Sorted Arrays: Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

Find Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Find Duplicate Number: Given an array containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), find the duplicate number.

Product of Array Except Self: Given an array nums of n integers, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Two Sum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Container With Most Water: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai), n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Move Zeroes: Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Stock Buy Sell to Maximize Profit: Given an array of stock prices on each day, find the maximum profit that can be earned by buying and selling stocks.

Pascal's Triangle: Generate Pascal's triangle up to n rows.

Majority Element: Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

Spiral Matrix: Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
